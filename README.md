Simple react map component as example or for reuse. It uses [MapLib](https://github.com/kartverket/maplib) and the configuration from [Norgeskart3](https://github.com/kartverket/norgeskart3) which is source code for [Norgeskart](https://www.norgeskart.no/)

To change the map to a grey map, just change in mapHelper.js in config the visibility option for "Gr√•tone" to true.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
